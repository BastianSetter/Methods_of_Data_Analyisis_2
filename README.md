# Grade project for "Methods of Data Analysis 2"
## Task
Train a deep neural network, capable of denoising radio signals measured by the Radio-Neutrino-Observatory Greenland (RNO-G).
## Content
 - First a general look at the data has been taken in `analysis.ipynb`
 - Next a model has been defined and optimised for optimal performance in `networks.ipynb`. In order to measure said performance, 5 custom metrics have been derived.
 - The results have been put together as a report in `MODA2_Report_22408546.pdf`

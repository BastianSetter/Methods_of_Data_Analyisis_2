This repository contains the analysis scripts and report for the grade project within the university module "Methods of Data Analysis 2". 
The goal of the project is to denoise radio signals measured by the Radio-Neutrino-Observatory Greenland (RNO-G), by using deep neural networks.
First a general look at the data has been done in 'analysis.ipynb'. Next a model has been defined and optimised for optimal performance. In order to measure said performance 5 custom metrics have been derived.
